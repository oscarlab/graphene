   PAL
      Platform Adaption Layer.  The Graphene Library OS is programmed
      against a very simplified OS ABI --- roughly 40 simple functions that are
      easy to support on any host OS or hypervisor. This term is inherited from `Drawbridge <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/drawbridge/>`_.

      The PAL ABI is documented :doc:`here <pal/pal>`.

   SGX
      Software Guard Extensions is a set of instructions on Intel processors.
